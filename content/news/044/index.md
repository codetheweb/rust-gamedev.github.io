Welcome to the 44th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### [Applying 5 million pixel updates per second with Rust & wgpu](https://maxisom.me/posts/applying-5-million-pixel-updates-per-second)

![a render near the final state of /r/place](./r_place_render.jpg)

[@codetheweb](https://github.com/codetheweb) published an [article](https://maxisom.me/posts/applying-5-million-pixel-updates-per-second) that explores the basics of `wgpu` by optimizing a program that replays [/r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/). By the end, CPU usage is around 18-25% while applying an average of 5m pixel updates per second at 10,000x playback speed.
